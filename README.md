# Crush Crush Cheat
A cheat made for the Steam version of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/459820/Crush_Crush/">Crush Crush

Check out my cheat for [Blush Blush](https://github.com/Omega172/Blush-Blush-Cheat/) it's the same as this game but it's about guys instead

The key to show/hide the GUI is "Insert"

# Why?
Before I started this project, I was looking into reverse engineering and hacking Unity games, and I know the best way I learn is by doing

So I looked around on steam to find a free game made in Unity and I found Crush Crush, I was not interested in the content of the game just that it was made in Unity.

# IF THE MENU IS NOT SHOWING RUN THE GAME IN WINDOWED MODE AND EXPAND THE WINDOW BEFORE INJECTING THE CHEAT!!!
